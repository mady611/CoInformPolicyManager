<h6>Co-Inform is a EU-funded project involving top universities and SMEs in 7 European countries. The objective is to create tools to foster critical thinking and digital literacy for a better-informed society. These tools will be designed and tested with policymakers, journalists, and citizens in 3 different EU countries.</h6>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<h4>Co-Inform mission is to foster critical thinking and digital literacy.</h4>

<h6>People need to be aware of the consequences that misinformation has on democracy and how much it affects their lives. The aim is to foster informed and engaged communities, which constitute the foundations of a healthy democracy and together find a solution to misinformation.

Academic surveys have shown that online misinformation is becoming more difficult to identify. Online misinformation has the potential to deceive even readers with strong literacy skills. Our goal is to provide citizens, journalists, and policymakers with tools to spot ‘fake news’ online, understand how they spread, and obtain access to verified information.</h6>
